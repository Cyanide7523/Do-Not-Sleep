# DO NOT SLEEP

## Overview ::
**Do not Sleep** is a coaching app for helping not to get sleepy during work time. 

## Concept & Planning ::
**Do not Sleep** works with smart devices. It continuously checks user's status with properties such as movement of wrist, heartbeat rate, etc... If it detects sleeping, rings an alarm to wake you up, and gives you some advices of waking up yourself. 

Of course, you may don't want to getting an annoying alarm at 1:00 AM, so you can set a specific time slots to get a coach. 

**Do not Sleep**'s objective is *NOT* a full-auto wake up call, *NOT* a solution of productivity increasement, just **coach** your habit. 

**Do not Sleep** basically needs smart devices. So I'm planning to support as much as I can. There are lots of smart devices like Apple's Apple Watch Series, Samsung's Galaxy Gear Series, LG's LG Watch, Shaomi's Mi Band, and more.
